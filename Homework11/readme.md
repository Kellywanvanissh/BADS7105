## Homework 11

From Customer review, using the review to capture key essence and see what they like to review about

First, we remove unneccesary word out using stopword list from pythinlp and mannual list in word that we notice from skimming through the reviews
then we use genism to capture the topic then visualizing graph. however, genism may have problem occassionally and not always supported in some application and old version
so we create def topic2Array to match keyword into sentence, using model_numtopics function

From the result we can see that consumers love to review about Shabushabu around pricing, food quality, staff & service.
However, this still require human to work on sentence rearranging and grouping to make the result clearer and able to utilize for further CRM/Marketing work
