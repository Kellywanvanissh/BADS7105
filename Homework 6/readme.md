From this information we can classify customers into total of 3 segmentations using total spending and total visit information
1) Top spender: group 1 & 5 => this is the group shop need to nurture well and treat with extra care to boost up sales. Rewards program should be very effective for this group.
2) Occassionally visitor : Group 2 & 3=> they come but not often and each visit may not yield high spending value. Seasonal or occassional promotion type might be used to boost up sales
3) Low value: group 4 => these are one-time shopper who might just stopped by and never visit us again
